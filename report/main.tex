% Abstract
\chapter*{Abstract}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Abstract}

This report presents a comprehensive overview of my engineering internship experience at ADDINN Tunisia, which spanned 2 months focusing on the development of SmartClaim, an intelligent multichannel platform for automotive insurance claim management. The internship was structured around two primary domains: Mobile Development and Data Engineering, providing a unique opportunity to gain hands-on experience in both front-end user interface development and back-end artificial intelligence systems.

In the Mobile Development component, I contributed to the development of the SmartClaim mobile application using cross-platform development frameworks. This application serves as the primary interface for policyholders to interact with the insurance claim system, offering features such as secure authentication, comprehensive claim declaration with multimedia attachments, real-time tracking, and integrated camera functionality for document capture. The project involved implementing user-friendly interfaces, integrating with AI services for damage detection, and ensuring responsive design across multiple mobile platforms.

The Data Engineering component focused on developing an automated Damage Location Detection Model using advanced computer vision algorithms. This AI-powered system enables real-time analysis of vehicle damage images submitted through the mobile application, providing accurate and objective damage assessment. The work involved dataset preparation, model training using machine learning frameworks, and API integration to connect the mobile application with the AI services.

Throughout the internship, I acquired valuable technical skills in mobile application development, artificial intelligence and computer vision, as well as modern development methodologies including agile frameworks. The project utilized industry-standard tools for version control, project management, and containerization for deployment.

This report details the SmartClaim project architecture, the development methodologies employed, challenges faced during development, and solutions implemented. It also reflects on the skills acquired and provides insights into the professional development achieved through contributing to an innovative insurance technology solution.

\section{Introduction}



This chapter presents the implementation of an automated Damage Location Detection Model for SmartClaim's data engineering platform. Using computer vision and YOLO architecture, the system replaces time-consuming manual vehicle inspections with fast, accurate automated damage analysis. The chapter covers methodology, implementation, and results.

\section{Project Overview and Context}


The Damage Location Detection Model represents a critical component of the SmartClaim ecosystem, designed to streamline the insurance claims process by providing automated, objective assessment of vehicle damages. Traditional visual inspection methods suffer from inherent limitations including time consumption, subjective assessment variations, and potential human error. The development of this automated system addresses these challenges by leveraging state-of-the-art computer vision technologies to deliver consistent, accurate, and rapid damage detection capabilities.

The system integrates seamlessly with the SmartClaim mobile application, enabling users to capture and submit vehicle damage photographs for immediate analysis. This integration supports the platform's objective of providing real-time claim processing capabilities while maintaining high standards of accuracy and reliability.



\section{Dataset Analysis and Preparation}

\subsection{Dataset Selection and Acquisition}

For this project, the dataset was provided by my supervisor from Roboflow Universe, containing approximately 10,000 high-quality images with exceptional diversity across damage types, vehicle models, and environmental conditions. The dataset features professional annotation with precise bounding box coordinates and accurate damage classification labels, making it ideal for vehicle damage detection in insurance claim processing scenarios.

    \label{fig:roboflow_dataset}
\end{figure}





\subsection{Data Preprocessing Pipeline}

The preprocessing pipeline was designed to optimize image data for YOLO model training while maintaining the integrity of damage location information. The comprehensive pipeline incorporated several essential preprocessing steps to ensure optimal model performance:

\subsubsection{Dataset Split Configuration}

The dataset was systematically divided into three distinct sets following machine learning best practices:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Training Set:} 70\% of total images (7,009 images) - Used for model training and parameter optimization
    \item \textbf{Validation Set:} 20\% of total images (1,998 images) - Used for hyperparameter tuning and model selection
    \item \textbf{Test Set:} 10\% of total images (986 images) - Used for final model evaluation and performance assessment
\end{itemize}

This distribution ensures adequate training data while maintaining sufficient validation and testing samples for robust performance evaluation.

\subsubsection{Data Quality Assurance}

Comprehensive data cleaning procedures were implemented to ensure dataset integrity:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Duplicate Detection and Removal:} Systematic identification and elimination of duplicate images to prevent data leakage and overfitting
    \item \textbf{Error Correction:} Identification and correction of annotation errors and inconsistencies in damage labeling
    \item \textbf{Quality Control:} Manual review and validation of image quality standards and annotation accuracy
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Image Preprocessing Operations}

The following preprocessing operations were applied to standardize the dataset:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Auto-Orient:} Applied automatic image orientation correction to ensure consistent image positioning
    \item \textbf{Resize:} Standardized image dimensions using stretch to 640x640 pixels to match YOLO input requirements while maintaining processing efficiency
    \item \textbf{Auto-Adjust Contrast:} Implemented histogram equalization for enhanced contrast and improved feature visibility across varying lighting conditions
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Data Augmentation Strategy}

After careful analysis of the dataset quality and diversity, it was determined that additional data augmentation was not necessary. The original dataset's comprehensive coverage of damage scenarios, lighting conditions, and vehicle orientations provided sufficient variability for robust model training without requiring artificial augmentation techniques.

\section{Model Architecture and Development}

\subsection{YOLO Framework Selection}

The selection of YOLO (You Only Look Once) as the primary detection framework was based on several technical and practical considerations. During the development process, extensive experimentation was conducted with multiple YOLO versions to identify the optimal architecture for vehicle damage detection:

\subsubsection{YOLO Version Comparison and Selection}

Comprehensive testing was performed across multiple YOLO architectures:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{YOLOv5:} Initial experiments with various YOLOv5 variants to establish baseline performance
    \item \textbf{YOLOv8:} Evaluation of the latest architectural improvements and performance enhancements
    \item \textbf{YOLOv11:} Testing of the most recent YOLO developments for cutting-edge performance
\end{itemize}

After comprehensive evaluation across different metrics including accuracy, inference speed, and model size, \textbf{YOLOv8s (small)} emerged as the optimal choice for this project, delivering the best balance of detection accuracy and processing efficiency suitable for mobile application integration.

    project="training_results",
    name="stage2", 
    resume=False,
    save_period=25  # Save weights every 25 epochs
)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Hyperparameter Configuration}
The training process utilized the following key hyperparameters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Epochs:} 100 per training stage (300 total across all phases)
    \item \textbf{Image Size:} 640x640 pixels for optimal detection accuracy
    \item \textbf{Batch Size:} 16 images per batch, optimized for available GPU memory
